# AscendStats9

"AscendStats9" is a multifaceted program designed to tackle various data manipulation and analysis tasks within a computational environment. The project revolves around sorting an array of numbers in ascending order using the Comb1 sort algorithm, a method specifically provided by a professor. However, the functionality of "AscendStats9" extends far beyond mere sorting.

In addition to sorting the array, the program computes essential statistical measures such as the minimum, maximum, median, sum, and average of the sorted list. But what sets "AscendStats9" apart is its unique output format – all results are displayed in base9 format, adding a creative twist to the traditional numerical presentation.

The heart of the program lies in its ability to seamlessly convert integer values to ASCII nonary strings, thanks to a meticulously crafted macro named "int2aNonary." This macro handles the conversion process efficiently and accurately, ensuring that the output is presented in the desired format.

Furthermore, "AscendStats9" boasts a user-friendly interface, with clear and concise output that facilitates easy interpretation of the computed statistics. Each result is accompanied by a descriptive header, enhancing readability and understanding.

Overall, "AscendStats9" is not just a sorting and statistical analysis tool – it's a testament to the fusion of computational prowess and creative presentation, making it a valuable asset for data enthusiasts and programmers alike.
